# Weather App

In this app, you can check the weather of any city! It also provides a forecast of the next five days. I utilize bootstrap 5 for my design. There is also a search history function that will save your search history in local storage. You can click on past searches to quickly bring up old searches. Note: the local storage feature is not available on mobile at this time.

## FYI

Sometimes the API's take about 20 seconds to load. Keep this in mind when testing.
